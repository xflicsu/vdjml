Instructions for building VDJML

The build process is managed by Boost.Build V2 (http://www.boost.org/boost-build2).
Libraries required by VDJML are listed in file "vdjml/doc/user-config.jam".

1. Download current distribution of Boost (http://www.boost.org/).
   Expand the archive to a directory on your hard drive, 
   e.g., to "C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_55_0".
   In this document, this directory will be referred as $(BOOST).

2. In your terminal, change directory to $(BOOST)/tools/build/v2/.
   Run script bootstrap.(bat or sh).  
   This will produce Boost.Build executable, e.g., $(BOOST)/tools/build/v2/b2.exe.

3. (optional) Add directory of Boost.Build executable to your PATH variable,
   e.g., "$(BOOST)/tools/build/v2"

4. If not already present, copy file "vdjml/doc/boost-build.jam" to 
   any directory above vdjml.  
   Edit the file to specify full path to Boost.Build.
   For details see "vdjml/doc/boost-build.jam" file.

5. If not already present, copy file "vdjml/doc/user-config.jam" to 
   your HOME directory.
   Edit the file to specify compilers and libraries used by VDJML. 
   For details see "vdjml/doc/user-config.jam" file.

6. Run Boost.Build executable in directory vdjml.  Examples:
        b2 release
        b2 debug test
        b2 --toolset=msvc release
        b2 autodoc
   The output will be generated in directory vdjml/out, e.g.,
   vdjml/out/bin/gcc-4.5.2/release/link-static/threading-multi/lib_vdjml.a
   vdjml/out/html/api.html
